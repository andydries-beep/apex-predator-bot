## PART 1: THE LAYMAN'S SUMMARY

### What Happened This Week

This was Week 1 — the week we built the entire Apex Predator Trading System from scratch and got it running 24/7 for free. The crypto market was absolutely miserable this week. The Fear & Greed Index sat at 6 out of 100, which is classified as "Extreme Fear." To put that in perspective, 6 is about as scared as the market gets. People are panic selling, nobody wants to buy, and the mood is grim.

Bitcoin was sitting around $100,299 AUD, which sounds like a lot, but it had been dropping all week. The Fear & Greed trend over the past 7 days told the story: 14 → 14 → 17 → 14 → 12 → 9 → 6. That is a steady slide deeper into fear territory.

Despite the doom and gloom, some coins showed signs of life. Ethereum had a decent +7.47% day, and Solana and Sui both scored 109/160 — just 1 point short of the safety threshold.

### What The Bot Did

The bot ran two full market scans today (one earlier and one later in the day). It scanned 250 coins each time, filtered out stablecoins and low-volume junk, and scored the top 20 candidates using the 160-point Striker Engine.

The catalyst detector pulled 11 news posts from CryptoPanic and analysed sentiment. The regime monitor confirmed we are firmly in BEAR territory and automatically raised the minimum score threshold from 95 to 110 to protect capital.

### What We Acted On (or Didn't)

We did not enter any trades this week, and that was the right call. The system is designed to keep you out of the market when conditions are dangerous, and conditions are very dangerous right now. Solana and Sui came closest to qualifying, but the system correctly held them back.

This is not a failure — this is the system doing its job. The best trade is sometimes no trade at all.

### Hindsight — What We Learned Looking Back

Looking back at this week, the biggest lesson is patience. The market is in Extreme Fear, and historically, Extreme Fear is where the best buying opportunities eventually appear — but not yet. The Fear & Greed Index is still falling (from 14 down to 6 over the week), which means we have not hit the bottom yet. Jumping in now would be catching a falling knife.

The other lesson is that getting the system automated was the single most important thing we could do. Before today, every scan required Andy to come online and trigger it manually. Now the bot watches 24/7 and will catch the moment conditions improve — even at 3 AM.

### The Score This Week

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Market Regime | BEAR |
| Fear & Greed Range | 6 — 17 |
| Best Scoring Coin | Solana (SOL) at 109/160 |
| Trades Entered | 0 |
| Trades Closed | 0 |
| P&L This Week | $0.00 |
| Running Total P&L | $0.00 |
| Capital | $321.60 |

## PART 2: EXPLAIN IT LIKE I'M 5

Imagine you have a lemonade stand, and you want to buy lemons to make lemonade and sell it for money.

This week, all the grown-ups in the neighbourhood were really scared. They were running around yelling "THE SKY IS FALLING!" and selling their lemons for really cheap because they were panicking. Some lemons that used to cost $1 were now only 50 cents.

Now, you COULD buy those cheap lemons right now. But here is the thing — the grown-ups are STILL panicking. Tomorrow those lemons might be 40 cents. Or 30 cents. If you buy now, you might feel silly tomorrow when they get even cheaper.

So what did we do? We built a really smart robot helper. This robot watches the lemon market ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT, even when you are sleeping. It checks the prices, reads the news, and counts how scared everyone is.

Right now, the robot is saying: "Everyone is SUPER scared (6 out of 100 scared). Do NOT buy lemons yet. Wait until people calm down a little bit."

And that is exactly what we are doing — waiting. Our robot is watching. When the time is right, it will tap us on the shoulder and say "Hey! NOW is a good time to buy lemons!" And then we will make our move.

This week we built the robot. Next week, we let it watch.

## PART 3: KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **The system is live and automated.** The bot runs 24/7 on Koyeb for free, scanning the market daily and sending Telegram alerts. No more manual triggers needed.

2. **Extreme Fear means stay out — for now.** Fear & Greed at 6 is dangerously low. The system correctly raised the score threshold to 110 and blocked all trades. Patience is the strategy.

3. **No trade is a good trade.** In a BEAR market with falling Fear & Greed, preserving capital is more important than finding opportunities. The $321.60 is safe and ready for when conditions improve.

## PART 4: LOOKING AHEAD

**What to watch for next week:**

The big question is whether the Fear & Greed Index stabilises or keeps falling. If it bounces back above 15-20, we might start seeing coins break through the 110 threshold. Solana and Sui are the ones to watch — they were knocking on the door at 109.

The bot will continue its daily scans at 8 AM AWST and hourly catalyst checks. If any major news breaks (exchange listings, partnerships, regulatory changes), the catalyst detector will pick it up and alert via Telegram.

For now, we sit tight and let the robot do its job.
